Get Monthly Tips and Tools to Level Up as a Developer

Hey guys,

Every month, I sit down and write a hand crafted letter to my students. It usually contains the latest things I've learnt or discovered. The goal is to keep you inspired and motivated on your journey to becoming a developer.

In addition, the tech world moves very fast and it's difficult to keep on top of all the new developments, tools and skills. So in every edition of the L.A.B. Report, you'll discover 5 new things. The best of what I've read or discovered on topics such as Design, Programming, Startup Growth and more.

You can see a sample here and decide whether if this is something you would want to receive once a month. 

If you think this will be useful for you, and only if you really want it, then you can sign up over here:
