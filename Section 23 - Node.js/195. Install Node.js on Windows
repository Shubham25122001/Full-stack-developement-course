Install Node.js on Windows
Installation Steps

Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site. 

Choose the LTS version that’s shown on the left. 

Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)

Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).



5. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.

6. Confirm that Node has been installed successfully on your computer by opening a Hyper terminal and typing in the commands node --version

You should see the version of node you just installed.
