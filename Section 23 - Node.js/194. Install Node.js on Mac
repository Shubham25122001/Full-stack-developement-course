Installation Steps

Download the Mac installer from the Nodes.js® web site. 

Choose the Long Term Support version that’s shown on the left. 


Run the installer (double-click on the .pkg file you downloaded in the previous step.)

NOTE: If you are running macOS Catalina 10.15, you might get a warning pop up that looks like this:


To solve this issue, just right click (hold down the control key on the keyboard and click) on the .pkg file and select "Open With" and then select "Installer (default)".




Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).

Confirm that node has been installed successfully by opening a Hyper terminal and entering the command

node --version

You should see the version of node you have just installed.
