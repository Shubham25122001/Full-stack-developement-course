A Note About 2023 Course Updates
Hey guys,



It's Angela here, your instructor from the Complete Web Development Bootcamp. How's your weekend going? I hope you're ready because I'm about to make it a lot better.



The HTML, CSS and Bootstrap sections in the course has been completely updated. Re-recorded and includes brand-new modules on CSS Flexbox, Grid and Bootstrap 5.



Here are some key innovations that you'll see in the shiny new modules:

+ Shorter modules and more projects so you're building more.

+ More coding exercises to give you more practice, almost one in every lesson.

+ Interactive quizzes that you can use your phone to answer.

+ Hand-annotated videos to make lessons easier to understand.

+ CSS Flexbox, Grid and updated Bootstrap 5 modules to keep you on the bleeding edge of the web development world.

+ More downloadable resources to work on to make this a code-first course.

+ Much, much more.



The best part?



To celebrate reaching the massive milestone of teaching 2 Million students world-wide, I'm releasing the updates completely for free for existing students on the course.



You can already head over and see the 12 brand-new modules uploaded. (You might want to log out of Udemy and log back in again if you don't see the changes).



What if you're still working through the old versions of the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap sections? Don't worry, I got you fam. I've duplicated the old content into a free to access course here:

You don't need to signup or sign in or give your email to access it. Just click on the preview button in the curriculum and you'll get access to all the outdated videos for free.



Wishing you all the success in the world!



Your instructor,

Angela



P.S. We're doing another AAA (Ask Angela Anything) in June this year to celebrate teaching 2 Million students. If you're a student who followed me from the start, you'll remember these impromptu AMAs. Keep an eye out in the May edition of our L.A.B. Report Newsletter for a join link and for the chance to submit questions.
